FREE 99% Vanilla Portfolio Site!

This site is developed entirely in typescript & sass and does not use any 3rd party libraries as dependencies (except for Firebase to fetch a download counter variable). The codebase is fully documented in case you'd like to poke around, compile a specific module or borrow a snippet from here or there.

A Reminder: there are only two specific use-case selectors typescript checks for to determine extended functionality: 'prevent-default' and 'mobile-ready'. mobile-ready allows for th hover on and off states to be converted to touch so that they work on mobile sized browsers and devices. 'prevent-default' work exclusively on anchor links and prevent the default action of scrolling from one section to another as is the case with the sports science analytics section.
